# Employee-Salary-Predictor
The Employee Salary Predictor is an AI-powered system designed to estimate employee salaries based on key attributes such as education, experience, job role, work hours, and demographic details. Built using a Decision Tree algorithm, this tool leverages machine learning techniques to identify patterns in historical salary data and generate accurate predictions. The frontend is developed using Streamlit, providing users with an intuitive interface to input values and receive real-time salary estimates.
In addition to the core prediction functionality, the application includes modern features such as Dark/Light mode toggle, PDF report generation, and an optional chatbot assistant to provide resume tips and negotiation advice. This project demonstrates the power of integrating data science with user-centric design to create intelligent decision-support tools for HR departments and job seekers.
